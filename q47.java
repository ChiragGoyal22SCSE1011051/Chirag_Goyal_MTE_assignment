• Histogram problems typically involve arrays of bars of varying heights, where each element
in the array represents the height of a bar.
  
• Common applications include:


1. Largest rectangle in a histogram — Finding the largest area under the histogram bars.
2. Trapping rainwater — Calculating how much water can be trapped between the
histogram bars.
3. Histogram equalization — Used in image processing to improve the contrast of an
image.
