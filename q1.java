A prefix sum array is an array where each element at index i stores the sum of elements from index 0 to i in the original array. It allows for efficient range sum queries in constant time after a linear time preprocessing step.
  
  Applications include:
•	Range sum queries
•	Subarray sum problems
•	Optimization in dynamic programming
•	Frequency count optimizations
