A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains data and a reference (or
link) to the next node in the sequence.
  
Applications in algorithm design:

• Efficient insertion/deletion:-> Insertion or deletion can be done in 0(1) time if the node is
given.
• Dynamic data structures:-> Linked lists can grow or shrink in size dynamically without
reallocating or resizing.
• Graph and tree representations:-> Used in adjacency lists, and can be used for sparse matrices
in graphs
