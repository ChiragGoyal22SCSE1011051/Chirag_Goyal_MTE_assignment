• Subsets: A subset is any selection of elements from a set, without considering the order of elements. 
  Example: For {I, 2}, the subsets are [J, [I], [2], [I, 2].

  
• Permutations: A permutation is an ordered arrangement of elements. 
  Example: For {1, 2}, the permutations are [1, 2] and [2, 1].
