• Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method used to solve problems by breaking them down into
simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the results to avoid
redundant computations.
  

•In the maximum subarray problem, DP can be used to keep track of the maximum sum of
the subarrays ending at each position in the array.
  
Kadane's algorithm is an example of a DP solution, where the maximum sum is computed iteratively while reusing the results of
previous subproblems.
