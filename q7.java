The sliding window technique involves creating a window which can either be fixed or dynamic in size and moving it over the input to solve problems efficiently. 
  It helps in reducing the time complexity of problems involving arrays or strings.
  In string problems, 
  it's used for:
  
•	Finding the longest/shortest substring with certain properties
• Detecting anagrams
•	Pattern matching
• Optimizing space/time over brute-force solutions
