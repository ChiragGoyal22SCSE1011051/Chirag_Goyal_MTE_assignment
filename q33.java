The sliding window technique involves maintaining a subset of elements in a sequence, usually in a
contiguous block. The window l'slides" over the array, expanding or contracting as needed.
  
Applications:
1.Maximum/Minimum in a sliding window
2.Longest substring without repeating characters
3.Subarray sum or product problems
4.String matching problems

For example,
  finding the maximum sum of a subarray of size k can be solved by maintaining a window of size k and moving it across the array.
