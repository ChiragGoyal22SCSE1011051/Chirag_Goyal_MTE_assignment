Explanation:
Bit manipulation refers to the process of directly manipulating bits in a number using bitwise
operators. It allows for efficient computation, especially for problems involving numbers and sets.
  
Key advantages include:
• Faster execution: Bit operations are computationally inexpensive
• Space optimization: Storing large sets or numbers using fewer bits.
• Efficient algorithms: Used in dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and finding subsets.
