• A priority queue is a data structure where each element is associated with a priority.
• Elements with higher priorities are dequeued before those with lower priorities.

Applications in algorithm design:
1. Heap sort: A sorting algorithm using a priority queue (heap).
2. Dijkstra's algorithm: For finding the shortest path in graphs.
3. Huffman coding: For optimal encoding in data compression.
4. Kth largest/smallest elements: Priority queues are used for efficiently finding the
top K elements in an array.
